## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **The main topology now runs the real connectors, not the stub.** `topologies/newspack-ai-newsletter.tsl` replaces the single `Stub_Source` head with the three live connectors (`github`, `linear`, `feed`) fanned into the summarizer. They emit nothing until configured (`github_repos`/`github_token`, `linear_token`, `feeds`); trigger a source with `request_node <source> TICK` and the digest with `request_node digest FLUSH`. `Stub_Source_Node` remains as a no-deps demo source (still in the catalog), just no longer wired by default.
- **Runtime triggers are now fire-and-forget `TM_REQUEST`s, not `TM_COMMAND` verbs.**
  The source's `tick` and the digest's `flush` were dispatched as `TM_COMMAND` verbs
  through a sibling `{node}:config` interpreter (`Schema_Reflection` +
  `auto_wire_interpreter`). Per the Tachikoma convention — `TM_COMMAND` is for
  startup/administration, runtime triggers are `TM_REQUEST` — `Stub_Source` and
  `Digest_Builder` now handle a `TM_REQUEST` directly in `fill()` (TICK / FLUSH),
  emit downstream fire-and-forget, and declare the trigger under
  `node_schema()['requests']` so the console renders a request button. Trigger from
  the REPL with `request_node source TICK` / `request_node digest FLUSH`.

### Added

- **Publisher Insights React dashboard.** `src/dashboard/` is now a real control panel (built to `build/dashboard`, enqueued on the Publisher Insights admin page). It mounts a node graph (`useInsightsGraph`) that polls the `Insights_CI` `insights` verb over the substrate `_http` boundary — page-visibility-gated, interval poll, reply pivot `FROM=insights:view` — and renders the scored digest model (`{ sources, top:[{source,title,score}], accumulated }`) as KPI stats, proportion bars, and a ranked table, plus a "Create draft post" action that POSTs a WordPress draft via `@wordpress/api-fetch` and links to its editor. Ported from the `newspack-nodes/examples/example-ai-newsletter` teaching dashboard; the JS test harness gains `@testing-library/react` + `@testing-library/jest-dom` (7 suites / 36 tests).
- **Summarizer publishes `set_state` observability.** The Summarizer was a black box — it emitted enriched items but published no state, so a traced node (`debug_state > 0`) streamed nothing to the REPL. It now `set_state( 'SUMMARIZED', { id, title, summary, relevance_score, via } )` per item (`via` = `llm` | `heuristic`) and `set_state( 'ENRICH_FAILED', { id, error } )` when an LLM call errors before falling back. Trace the node to watch items flow.
- **Settings UI — a classic settings page for the AI proxy + connector credentials.** Every `Settings` field now carries a `render` + `sanitize` callback (text/password inputs; one-entry-per-line textareas for the `github_repos`/`feeds` lists), so the substrate `Schema` actually wires them via the Settings API — previously the fields were declared without callbacks and silently skipped, so there was no UI. A new **Publisher Insights → Settings** submenu (`manage_options`-gated) renders the form (`settings_fields` + `do_settings_sections` + save). Secrets render as password inputs; list values sanitize to trimmed, non-empty arrays; `relevance_profile` is a multi-line textarea (newlines preserved via `sanitize_textarea_field`). The list/textarea fields are fixed-width (not full-bleed) and the repo/feed lists show 14 rows. (The React dashboard handles insights *display* separately.)
- **Connector substrate — `Source_Node` base.** A new abstract `Source_Node extends Node implements Source` owns the uniform connector behavior so each connector supplies only `fetch( $config )` (the blocking HTTP call) and `config()` (its Settings read). On a fire-and-forget `TICK` (`TM_REQUEST`) it fetches, dedups by item `id` against an in-process bounded set (`MAX_SEEN = 2000`, oldest evicted), and emits each new item as `TM_STRUCT`. It also provides `normalize_item()` (the shared `{source,id,title,url,body,timestamp}` coercion) and `source_schema()` (the shared Source node_schema) so connectors don't restate either. (Dedup is per-worker-lifetime; durable cross-respawn dedup is a follow-up — it belongs at the ingest layer keyed by id, not in the head source.)
- **Connector — GitHub source.** `Github_Source_Node` fetches Releases, Merged PRs (closed with a `merged_at`), and Issues (the issues endpoint's PR entries are dropped) for every repo in the `github_repos` setting, normalized to the item contract with stable ids (`github:owner/repo#release-11` / `#pr-5` / `#issue-7`). Bearer auth + `User-Agent` when `github_token` is set. A failed repo/endpoint contributes nothing and never throws. Trigger `request_node github TICK`; the `wp_remote_get` call sits behind `Github_Source_Node::$http_get`.
- **Connector — Linear source.** `Linear_Source_Node` POSTs a GraphQL query for recently-updated issues (raw-token `Authorization`, no `Bearer`) and normalizes `data.issues.nodes[]` to the item contract (`linear:ABC-123`). No token → no call; transport error / non-200 / GraphQL-error body → nothing, never throws. Trigger `request_node linear TICK`; behind `Linear_Source_Node::$http_post`.
- **Settings — `github_repos` list + `Settings::get_array()`.** A new `github_repos` connector field (list of `owner/name`) and a list-config reader that returns the stored value as a trimmed, non-empty list of strings (shared by the `feeds` + `github_repos` connectors).
- **Connector — RSS/Atom Feed source.** `Feed_Source_Node` (a `Source_Node`) fetches
  every URL in the `feeds` setting and normalizes both RSS 2.0 (`channel/item`) and
  Atom (`entry`) into the digest item contract `{source,id,title,url,body,timestamp}`.
  The id prefers the RSS `guid` / Atom `id` and falls back to the link, so it stays
  stable across ticks. Atom link selection prefers `rel="alternate"` (the canonical
  URL) over a leading `rel="self"`/`edit`; RSS dating falls back to Dublin Core
  `<dc:date>` when `<pubDate>` is absent. The body is parsed with `LIBXML_NONET`
  (untrusted third-party XML). A feed that transport-errors, returns non-200, or won't
  parse contributes nothing and never throws. Trigger with `request_node feed TICK`;
  the `wp_remote_get` call sits behind the `Feed_Source_Node::$http_get` closure seam.

- **AI core — the Summarizer now calls the LLM.** Each item makes one AI API Proxy
  enrich call (`Prompts::enrich`) returning a one-line `summary`, a 0–10
  `relevance_score` (against the configured relevance profile), and a `reason`. When
  no `ai_proxy_token` is set or the proxy errors/returns unparseable JSON, it falls
  back to the heuristic summary (no score) and never throws. Driven by `Settings::get`
  / `Settings::llm_client` and the new `Prompts` builders.

- **AI core — the Scorer ranks by LLM relevance + recency + source.** When an item
  carries the Summarizer's `relevance_score`, the final score is
  `relevance × weight + recency_bonus(timestamp) + source_weight` (7-day half-life
  exponential recency decay); when it doesn't (Summarizer fell back), the existing
  keyword/source heuristic is used. No LLM call — purely deterministic.

- **AI core — the Digest builder composes an LLM briefing.** On `flush`, the top-10
  scored items are sent in one AI API Proxy call (`Prompts::digest`) to compose a
  "what mattered" markdown briefing (intro + grouped sections + per-item blurbs).
  No token / proxy error / empty result → falls back to the ranked bullet list. The
  offsetlog snapshot contract (`save_state`/`restore_state`) is unchanged.

- **Foundation of the `newspack-ai-newsletter` sibling plugin** — a team-intelligence
  digest built on the newspack-nodes substrate. This initial drop is the runnable
  pipeline skeleton + the shared seams; live sources, real LLM wiring, the dashboard,
  and publishing land in follow-on sub-projects.
  - Scaffold: build/lint/test tooling (composer + npm + jest + phpunit + phpcs +
    phpstan), the `@newspack-nodes/*` build aliases, release + pre-push wiring —
    mirroring `newspack-event-logger-nodes`.
  - Pipeline spine (ported from the `example-ai-newsletter` walkthrough, contracts
    preserved byte-for-byte): `Summarizer_Node`, `Scorer_Node`, `Digest_Builder_Node`,
    `Insights_CI_Node` (its `{sources,top,accumulated}` JSON model unchanged), plus a
    canned `Stub_Source_Node` so the graph runs end-to-end before real connectors exist.
  - Bootstrap + `topologies/newspack-ai-newsletter.tsl` (the real ingest→summarize→
    score→scored-partition→digest→log graph, stub source wired) + an Insights admin page
    (dashboard enqueue guarded until the React build ships).
  - `LLM_Client` interface + `Proxy_LLM_Client` targeting the Automattic AI API Proxy
    (OpenAI `chat/completions`; default model `gpt-oss-120b`), with a closure-HTTP test seam.
  - `Source` connector interface + `Settings` schema declaring the AI + connector config,
    flagging the credential fields (`ai_proxy_token`, `github_token`, `linear_token`) secret
    via the substrate's `register_args` extension seam.
