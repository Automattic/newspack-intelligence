## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Regenerate digest delegates to the worker instead of composing in the request graph.** Insights_CI's `generate` verb no longer reads the snapshot and composes itself; it routes a single `TM_REQUEST REGENERATE` to the worker's `digest` node over the input IPC partition (`{base}/ipc/newspack-ai-newsletter.p0/input` — the same request-graph→worker transport `collect` uses) and returns an ack. The worker's `Digest_Builder` (which handles `REGENERATE` on `TM_REQUEST`) composes from its live in-memory items and writes `digest:log`; the dashboard's poll surfaces the new draft. Removes the parallel request-graph compose path (`generate_json` / `read_snapshot_items`), so there's one digest writer. The dashboard's "Regenerate digest" button now shows a "Regenerating…" ack (or a no-worker error) and lets the poll bring in the result, mirroring Collect.

- **The collect pipeline runs through a durable `ingest` partition so the worker keeps heartbeating during a collect.** Sources append fetched items to a new `ingest` partition; an `ingest:consumer` (in `line_mode`) paces them one read-block per drain into Summarizer → Scorer → `scored`. Previously a `TICK` ran the fetch plus every item's blocking LLM enrich in one synchronous pass, freezing the worker's heartbeat (it went `[stale]` mid-collect); the buffer + paced consumer spread that work across drain cycles. Requires newspack-nodes with the Consumer `line_mode` verb.

- **Collect is reachable everywhere and clearly gated.** The Collect button now renders in the empty state too (you need it most when nothing's scored yet), shows `Collected X/3` (0 immediately on click), and is enabled only at a clean boundary — empty (`0`) or complete (`done >= total`) — so it can't double-fire mid-collection; an optimistic in-flight lock self-releases when the poll reflects the new cycle or after a timeout (so a no-op collection can't latch the button). A success ack ("Collecting from N worker(s)…") or a no-worker error now shows in both the empty and populated states.

- **The dashboard's top items are per-source (top 10 each), not one global list.** `Insights_CI::top_by_source` groups the scored items into a per-source top-10; the dashboard renders a ranked table per source (github / linear / feed) instead of one list a single high-scoring source dominated. The model's `top` is now keyed by source (`{ source: [{title, score}] }`).

- **The dashboard is a two-column layout.** The left column holds the KPI stat cards, "By source", and the "Newsletter" actions; the right column holds "Top items by source" as a single stacked column of per-source tables. Widens to use the wp-admin content area. The digest action button is now **Regenerate digest** (the durable digest composes on its own; this recomposes on demand), and the empty preview reads simply "No digest yet." The draft preview is taller (720px) so more of the markdown is visible without scrolling.

- **The digest covers every accumulated item, not just the top 10.** `Digest_Composer` previously sent only the top-10-by-score items into the LLM prompt, so the draft summarized 10 of (e.g.) 30 collected items while the no-LLM fallback already listed them all. It now ranks the whole set by score and sends all of it, with a larger output-token budget to fit the bigger briefing. One cycle's items are bounded (the builder resets per cycle).

- **The AI Newsletter settings page moved to the WordPress "Settings" menu.** It was a submenu under the Publisher Insights dashboard; it now registers under `options-general.php` as "Settings → AI Newsletter". Publisher Insights stays its own top-level dashboard.

- **The GitHub source fetches releases + merged PRs only (10 per page).** `Github_Source_Node` no longer pulls the issues endpoint (the `issues()` method was removed), trimming low-signal noise from the digest.

- **The Summarizer drops each item's `body` after summarizing it.** The `body` (release notes / PR descriptions / feed content) feeds the summary, but nothing past the Summarizer reads it (the Scorer uses `relevance_score`/`source`/`timestamp`; the digest and dashboard use `summary`/`title`/`score`/`url`). Stripping it there shrinks every downstream message plus the durable `scored` log and the digest snapshot — which previously carried a full body per accumulated item.

### Added

- **Collect button + live collection progress.** The dashboard's Newsletter section gains a **Collect** button that drives a full collection cycle: it sends a `collect` command to `Insights_CI`, which (since the sources live in the worker, not the request graph) writes a RESET then a TICK to each source into the worker's input IPC partition — the same transport `wp nodes cli` uses. Each `Source_Node`, after its fetch, emits a `TM_INFO DONE` (always — even if the fetch throws); Summarizer and Scorer now forward `TM_INFO` so the DONE flows down to the `Digest_Builder`, which counts **distinct sources reported** into its snapshot as `done`/`total`. The dashboard shows "Collected X/total" and gates the buttons accordingly: **Regenerate digest** only enables once every source has reported (`done >= total`), and **Copy markdown** / **Create draft post** only once a digest exists. `collect` replies in JSON (`{collecting,workers}` or `{error}`) so the dashboard surfaces failures instead of guessing.

### Fixed

- **Create-draft converts markdown tables to real table blocks.** The composer's digests often use GFM tables (e.g. a Release / Key changes grid), but `markdownToBlocks` had no table support, so "Create draft post" dumped the raw `| … |` rows into a paragraph (pipes and all) — even though "Copy markdown" → paste worked, because the editor's own paste handler converts tables. `markdownToBlocks` now emits a `core/table` block (`<thead>`/`<tbody>`) for a header-plus-delimiter table, and renders `<br>` inside cells as a real line break (with autolinks/bold intact).
- **The dashboard's status notes no longer linger forever.** The "Collecting from N worker(s)…" and "Regenerating… the draft updates on the next poll." acks had no reliable clear path (the collect lock's timeout released the lock but left the note; the regenerate note only cleared on the next regenerate), so they stuck on screen. Both transient acks now auto-dismiss after a short delay.
- **Create-draft posts now open as valid Gutenberg blocks.** `markdownToBlocks` emitted an `<h2>` tag for every heading even when the block attribute said `{"level":3}`, so each `###` section failed the editor's save-validation ("Block contains unexpected or invalid content"). The heading tag now matches its level (`<h3>` for level 3).
- **The digest composes automatically once every source reports DONE — no manual FLUSH.** `Digest_Builder` now takes the source `total` as its sole argument (`make_node Digest_Builder digest 3`, where `3` MUST equal `count(Insights_CI::SOURCE_NODES)`) and composes + emits the markdown draft to `digest:tee` → `digest:log` the moment `count(distinct sources reported) === total`. The dashboard reads that durable `digest:log` on every poll, so a generated digest survives a page reload. The old `request_node digest FLUSH` trigger, the `scored_partition` nudge argument, and the manual-flush path are gone. The `Digest_Builder` still **dedupes accumulated items by id** (cleared on `RESET`, which the dashboard Collect sends before TICKing the sources; a dirty restored snapshot is deduped too), so the same item can't appear twice in a digest.

### Changed

- **The Scorer is now source-agnostic: it blends the LLM `relevance_score` with a recency bonus only.** The old per-source weight table keyed on `releases`/`community` — never the live `github`/`linear`/`feed` sources — so that term silently contributed zero for every real item; it's dropped. The no-LLM fallback (`score()`) stays a flat base plus title-keyword bumps. The relevance judgment lives upstream in the Summarizer's LLM `enrich` call; the Scorer just ranks.

- **The main topology now runs the real connectors, not the stub.** `topologies/newspack-ai-newsletter.tsl` replaces the single `Stub_Source` head with the three live connectors (`github`, `linear`, `feed`) fanned into the summarizer. They emit nothing until configured (`github_repos`/`github_token`, `linear_token`, `feeds`); trigger a source with `request_node <source> TICK` and the digest with `request_node digest FLUSH`. The canned `Stub_Source_Node` demo source has been removed now that the real connectors are wired.
- **Runtime triggers are now fire-and-forget `TM_REQUEST`s, not `TM_COMMAND` verbs.**
  The source's `tick` and the digest's `flush` were dispatched as `TM_COMMAND` verbs
  through a sibling `{node}:config` interpreter (`Schema_Reflection` +
  `auto_wire_interpreter`). Per the Tachikoma convention — `TM_COMMAND` is for
  startup/administration, runtime triggers are `TM_REQUEST` — the source nodes and
  `Digest_Builder` now handle a `TM_REQUEST` directly in `fill()` (TICK / FLUSH),
  emit downstream fire-and-forget, and declare the trigger under
  `node_schema()['requests']` so the console renders a request button. Trigger from
  the REPL with `request_node source TICK` / `request_node digest FLUSH`.

### Added

- **Publisher Insights React dashboard.** `src/dashboard/` is now a real control panel (built to `build/dashboard`, enqueued on the Publisher Insights admin page). It mounts a node graph (`useInsightsGraph`) that polls the `Insights_CI` `insights` verb over the substrate `_http` boundary — page-visibility-gated, interval poll, reply pivot `FROM=insights:view` — and renders the scored model (`{ sources, top, accumulated }`) as KPI stats, proportion bars, and a ranked table. The Newsletter section shows the **real LLM-rendered digest** (`Insights_CI` now also serves the latest `digest:log` content as `model.digest`): **Generate digest** recomposes a fresh one on demand via a new manage_options-gated `generate` verb (awaited request/reply over the graph), **Copy markdown** copies that digest, and **Create draft post** converts it to native Gutenberg blocks (`markdownToBlocks`) and POSTs a WordPress draft via `@wordpress/api-fetch`. The shared compose core lives in `Digest_Composer` so the worker FLUSH and the dashboard recompose can't drift. Ported from the `newspack-nodes/examples/example-ai-newsletter` teaching dashboard; the JS test harness gains `@testing-library/react` + `@testing-library/jest-dom`.
- **Nodes publish `set_state` lifecycle observability.** Traced nodes (`debug_state > 0`) now stream their progress to the REPL: the Summarizer emits `SUMMARIZED` (item title) on the LLM-enrich path and `FAILED` (title) when an LLM call errors; the Scorer emits `SCORED` (title); the Digest_Builder emits `RECEIVED` (title) per accumulated item and `COMPOSED` (item count) on FLUSH. Trace a node to watch items flow.
- **Settings UI — a classic settings page for the AI proxy + connector credentials.** Every `Settings` field now carries a `render` + `sanitize` callback (text/password inputs; one-entry-per-line textareas for the `github_repos`/`feeds` lists), so the substrate `Schema` actually wires them via the Settings API — previously the fields were declared without callbacks and silently skipped, so there was no UI. A new **Publisher Insights → Settings** submenu (`manage_options`-gated) renders the form (`settings_fields` + `do_settings_sections` + save). Secrets render as password inputs; list values sanitize to trimmed, non-empty arrays; `relevance_profile` is a multi-line textarea (newlines preserved via `sanitize_textarea_field`). The list/textarea fields are fixed-width (not full-bleed) and the repo/feed lists show 14 rows. (The React dashboard handles insights *display* separately.)
- **Connector substrate — `Source_Node` base.** A new abstract `Source_Node extends Node implements Source` owns the uniform connector behavior so each connector supplies only `fetch( $config )` (the blocking HTTP call) and `config()` (its Settings read). On a fire-and-forget `TICK` (`TM_REQUEST`) it fetches, dedups by item `id` against an in-process bounded set (`MAX_SEEN = 2000`, oldest evicted), and emits each new item as `TM_STRUCT`. It also provides `normalize_item()` (the shared `{source,id,title,url,body,timestamp}` coercion) and `source_schema()` (the shared Source node_schema) so connectors don't restate either. (Dedup is per-worker-lifetime; durable cross-respawn dedup is a follow-up — it belongs at the ingest layer keyed by id, not in the head source.)
- **Connector — GitHub source.** `Github_Source_Node` fetches Releases, Merged PRs (closed with a `merged_at`), and Issues (the issues endpoint's PR entries are dropped) for every repo in the `github_repos` setting, normalized to the item contract with stable ids (`github:owner/repo#release-11` / `#pr-5` / `#issue-7`). Bearer auth + `User-Agent` when `github_token` is set. A failed repo/endpoint contributes nothing and never throws. Trigger `request_node github TICK`; the `wp_remote_get` call sits behind `Github_Source_Node::$http_get`.
- **Connector — Linear source.** `Linear_Source_Node` POSTs a GraphQL query for recently-updated issues (raw-token `Authorization`, no `Bearer`) and normalizes `data.issues.nodes[]` to the item contract (`linear:ABC-123`). No token → no call; transport error / non-200 / GraphQL-error body → nothing, never throws. Trigger `request_node linear TICK`; behind `Linear_Source_Node::$http_post`.
- **Settings — `github_repos` list + `Settings::get_array()`.** A new `github_repos` connector field (list of `owner/name`) and a list-config reader that returns the stored value as a trimmed, non-empty list of strings (shared by the `feeds` + `github_repos` connectors).
- **Connector — RSS/Atom Feed source.** `Feed_Source_Node` (a `Source_Node`) fetches
  every URL in the `feeds` setting and normalizes both RSS 2.0 (`channel/item`) and
  Atom (`entry`) into the digest item contract `{source,id,title,url,body,timestamp}`.
  The id prefers the RSS `guid` / Atom `id` and falls back to the link, so it stays
  stable across ticks. Atom link selection prefers `rel="alternate"` (the canonical
  URL) over a leading `rel="self"`/`edit`; RSS dating falls back to Dublin Core
  `<dc:date>` when `<pubDate>` is absent. The body is parsed with `LIBXML_NONET`
  (untrusted third-party XML). A feed that transport-errors, returns non-200, or won't
  parse contributes nothing and never throws. Trigger with `request_node feed TICK`;
  the `wp_remote_get` call sits behind the `Feed_Source_Node::$http_get` closure seam.

- **AI core — the Summarizer now calls the LLM.** Each item makes one AI API Proxy
  enrich call (`Prompts::enrich`) returning a one-line `summary`, a 0–10
  `relevance_score` (against the configured relevance profile), and a `reason`. When
  no `ai_proxy_token` is set or the proxy errors/returns unparseable JSON, it falls
  back to the heuristic summary (no score) and never throws. Driven by `Settings::get`
  / `Settings::llm_client` and the new `Prompts` builders.

- **AI core — the Scorer ranks by LLM relevance + recency + source.** When an item
  carries the Summarizer's `relevance_score`, the final score is
  `relevance × weight + recency_bonus(timestamp) + source_weight` (7-day half-life
  exponential recency decay); when it doesn't (Summarizer fell back), the existing
  keyword/source heuristic is used. No LLM call — purely deterministic.

- **AI core — the Digest builder composes an LLM briefing.** On `flush`, the top-10
  scored items are sent in one AI API Proxy call (`Prompts::digest`) to compose a
  "what mattered" markdown briefing (intro + grouped sections + per-item blurbs).
  No token / proxy error / empty result → falls back to the ranked bullet list. The
  offsetlog snapshot contract (`save_state`/`restore_state`) is unchanged.

- **Foundation of the `newspack-ai-newsletter` sibling plugin** — a team-intelligence
  digest built on the newspack-nodes substrate. This initial drop is the runnable
  pipeline skeleton + the shared seams; live sources, real LLM wiring, the dashboard,
  and publishing land in follow-on sub-projects.
  - Scaffold: build/lint/test tooling (composer + npm + jest + phpunit + phpcs +
    phpstan), the `@newspack-nodes/*` build aliases, release + pre-push wiring —
    mirroring `newspack-event-logger-nodes`.
  - Pipeline spine (ported from the `example-ai-newsletter` walkthrough, contracts
    preserved byte-for-byte): `Summarizer_Node`, `Scorer_Node`, `Digest_Builder_Node`,
    `Insights_CI_Node` (its `{sources,top,accumulated}` JSON model unchanged), plus a
    canned `Stub_Source_Node` so the graph runs end-to-end before real connectors exist.
  - Bootstrap + `topologies/newspack-ai-newsletter.tsl` (the real ingest→summarize→
    score→scored-partition→digest→log graph, stub source wired) + an Insights admin page
    (dashboard enqueue guarded until the React build ships).
  - `LLM_Client` interface + `Proxy_LLM_Client` targeting the Automattic AI API Proxy
    (OpenAI `chat/completions`; default model `gpt-oss-120b`), with a closure-HTTP test seam.
  - `Source` connector interface + `Settings` schema declaring the AI + connector config,
    flagging the credential fields (`ai_proxy_token`, `github_token`, `linear_token`) secret
    via the substrate's `register_args` extension seam.
